Retirement eligibility checker (Graded question) 
Manna Corp. provides pension and other benefits to eligible retiring employees. The 
minimum age for retirement is 50 years. If a retiring employee’s age is at least 65 or their 
age plus years of service is at least 80 then that employee is eligible for a full pension. 
Otherwise, the retiring employee is eligible for a discounted (reduced) pension. Write a 
program that prompts the user for age and years of service, determines their eligibility, and 
prints the appropriate message as shown below.
